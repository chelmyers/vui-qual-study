<p>The user crafts very complicated ways to say phrases. This might be because they are uncomfortable with the task and haven’t done it with voice control or with other programs. This may be their way to think while saying.</p>

<p>User has not done a lot of these tasks outside voice control himself. He is not as confident with his phrases and has the most different responses we have seen so far.</p>

<p>The two people that want more than personal assistant tasks with voice control don’t use personal assistant aids whatsoever themselves.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Chelsea: Anyway, where were we. You said Alexa in ten minutes notify me, and it said in ten minutes, starting now. We’re not sure what it’s gonna do, but it will notify you.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: It will lock me out in a demonic hell for eternity in ten minutes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It’s casting a spell, its turn is starting now. It’s a sleep spell. Those take a while. Okay, great. Let’s move onto the second task then, which you realize you are out of salt. You’ve elected to manage your grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I need salt. Let me know that I need salt when I ask you if I need salt later on.</p>

<p>Alexa: Hmm. I’m not sure what you meant by that question.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: See the thing is I don’t really keep grocery lists.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. So if you do manage it at all, do you just go to the store?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Yeah because I go to Old Nelson for pretty much most of my groceries. So if I forget anything, I’ll just go back. I don’t have to … right here, Old Nelson is like five minutes away, might as well. I have nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So just go? Come back?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Go, yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right so maybe try to rephrase that one more time? Or it’s not necessary.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Okay. I’m out of salt, so make a list saying that I need salt.
 See I’m not sure about this because even if I had Alexa make a list, I probably wouldn’t look at it again.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s totally fine –</p>

<p>Alexa: I’ve added make to your to do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So Alexa, I think I added Make to your to do list. So apparently you have a to-do list that says make on it. Does that mean your expectations at all?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I will make. No, it doesn’t’.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So this isn’t a familiar process for you anyway, you don’t create lists, you don’t add groceries to them. And your grocery process is let the groceries - I’ll get them when I get them and I’ll get what I get.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. And don’t worry, if Alexa doesn’t understand, this is a test. Alexa, not just of you, so you can’t do anything wrong. That does mean don’t break my computer in any way …</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Alexa! Get me the fucking salt!</p>

<p>Chelsea: You know what, actually sometimes she does respond to violence.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Oh wow.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay so let’s move onto the third task.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Wait I want to try it. Alexa if you don’t get me some fucking salt right now, I will make you explode.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Processing. I really can’t wait to play this one - oh no, didn’t like it, gave up, quit. Sometimes it does that.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: She doesn’t like me.</p>

<p>Chelsea: But if you do things like shut up, or shut you bitch, she does that sometimes. Which is a little - someone had to program that. Okay so third task, should you wear a jacket today or not? Have Alexa fill you in about your city’s weather.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Alexa, what’s the temperature outside right now?</p>

<p>Alexa: Right now in Seattle, it’s 43 degrees with cloudy skies. Today’s forecast has showers with a high of 45 degrees and a low of 41 degrees.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Cause it’s default. So would you want to ask again?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: No, I think I’ve got everything I need to know.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, so how do you normally figure out weather if you do at all?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I don’t, I just walk outside. If its really bad, I’ll just walk inside.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, to the lab or Old Nelson’s. Awesome, so did the results meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: It went a little bit too far, but that’s okay that’s nice.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, and would you say that sentence again the same way or would you -</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah you would? Okay so you’re satisfied with the response to your phrase? Okay so let’s move onto the fourth task which is you’re getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Tell me news. I don’t know, this isn’t something I really do.</p>

<p>Alexa: In things to try, people caring for family members may find me helpful. Some tasks I can assist with are reading audio books, creating shopping lists, and playing music. You can also set up repeating alarms to help remember to do things at a specific time.</p>

<p>Chelsea: See, processing. It’s still working on it, it’s not done yet. It’s just a little slow.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: So helping family members is not actually news?</p>

<p>Chelsea: What do you think?</p>

<p>Alexa: In NPR news from tune in: live from NPR news in Washington, I’m Lax Mi Shing. After a turbulent first month in office, President Trump is preparing to appear before a joint session of congress tonight at nine eastern. He’s expected to get a warm -</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Stop.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, so how do you feel about the response Alexa gave to you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I mean she answered it. I feel like I don’t really understand what I wanted to hear. Like this isn’t something I normally do. If I’m interested in something, I will go out and search for it myself, I won’t ask a general question about current events. I would say what current events am I interested in right now? I want to learn more about President Trump or I want to learn more about something else. I won’t just say an umbrella term for current events.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So you don’t use any aggregated new sources?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Not really.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So your process is more to find something specific and go after that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay and that’s something that you do daily, weekly, or -</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Actually on my android, and it has this little thing where you swipe to the side and it will tell you stories for you. And by now it already knows what I’m interested in, and it will tell me things like GDC or league of Legends.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: So those are the kinds of news I’m interested in.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So based on what you asked, did what Alexa say meet the expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Yeah. I guess i asked for news and I got it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay and if you had to rephrase it, would you or would you ask the same way?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I would probably rephrase it by asking for something more specific, but just as of right now I don’t have any specific news I want to know about. Actually sure, let me try it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You can try.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Alexa, tell me about the ring city in Dark Souls three.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It has some Easter eggs -</p>

<p>Alexa: Hmm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay so -</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: The ring city is in Dark Souls three, and it’s not released yet but it’s a bit of information I’m after.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay awesome. So now I would like to move onto asking more general questions, first off what was the easiest prompt to - which did you feel most comfortable asking?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Probably news. It was easiest, it’s just that yeah, it was simple.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Was that all something you maybe heard Rhea do or … influenced?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Not really.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I remember that she also read the NPR segment.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. All right, what was the hardest for you to do or one that you felt least confident in your phrase?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: The grocery list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Grocery one? And why would you say that is?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: ‘cause it’s just - I’m not used to using grocery lists. I’m pretty sure if I was more conventional about it, then it would probably know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. And what I’m asking you is just more general. So what do you think about voice user interfaces in general? Any additional comments about where you see them going or something that stuck out to you during this?</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: I don’t know. I want to see voice user interfaces be more than realistic. I want them to just not be like a pocket secretary like asking a human to do things, I want them to be able to do something that only a computer could do and not just something that would be like talking to a very stupid human and hoping that they do what you want them to do. That’s kind of the trend with computers. Computers are just very autistic solvent humans, they don’t understand anything that you want them to do, you just have to be very precise about it. I know that voice user interfaces are trying to be more human-like, I don’t really like that direction so much.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That is interesting because we have these machines that don’t really work in ways that we understand, talking about the general public. We have our minds, the way we communicate, which is this one way, voice user interfaces do pose a interesting connection where it’s the machine talking to us in a way that we can. So there’s a lot of opportunities there. So I would agree with you, let’s stop making machines more like humans. Let’s start understanding machines and their infinite capabilities.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: If there was something that only a voice user interface could do and that proved to be something very useful, even if it wasn’t intuitive I would want to learn how to do it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah? Didn’t we do a reading like that in class like that? I did a reading that you would like that was pretty much - I don’t know if it was for seven eleven, but it was pretty much saying that - I think it was… I don’t know, but it’s pretty much saying our way of communication is so stupid. If we talked more like machines, we would be way better.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: Exactly. Maybe it was Tomimax?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Maybe it was, I forget. Qualifying exam papers, they’re all blurring together.</p>

<p>Interviewee #6: What are you doing?</p>
