<h2 id="memos">Memos</h2>
<p>User gets very frustrated when the VUI gives too much information and he cannot stop it.</p>

<p>So far, every interviewee has said task 1 the same way.</p>

<p>When a command is overheard, the user may repeat is blindly even though he is not familiar with the outcome.</p>

<p>User misinterpreted the flash briefly, was impatient, and stopped it all together. He assumed Alexa was more intelligent that is was and misheard his command, but was reading out menu options. Instead, Alexa was reading out the Flash Briefing (triggered by news phrase). Was this a mistake of Alexa or was the user not listening due to interview pressure?</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Chelsea: To start off, can you please state your name for me and that I have permission to record you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: My name is *** and I give Chelsea permission to record this.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. Thank you so much. What we’re doing today is I am looking into voice user interfaces and how we can actually benefit them in the future. Some of the questions that I have are about how you craft phrases when you interact with voice control and what previous knowledge do you depend upon if you are someone who’s new to voice control or if you have used it before. What we have today is I have a few questions for you and I have some tasks to do with Alexa. That’s why Alexa’s here. I’m keeping her muted because you know she gets really annoying when you talk about her and you don’t want to do anything with her. When we get to the task part I’ll unmute her.</p>

<p>Chelsea: During the session, it focuses on the problems with the system and not any problems with the user, so if you find something confusing or frustrated, it’s not you. It’s the system, and that’s what we’re trying to look into. The session’s going to take about 15 minutes. I’m going to again first ask you some questions and then we’re going to do some tasks afterwards. Do you have any questions so far?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Nope. Go for it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, awesome. The first question I have for you is, what is your previous experience with voice control and how do you use it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I ask Alexa the weather everyday in the morning, and maybe will ask her to play music. That’s about it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Is Alexa the only voice control that you have used so far?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I’ve tried my phone but it’s pretty frustrating. I don’t find the Google voice interface to be very useful.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And that’s the Google Assistant, right? It’s on Android?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: For Android, yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. So you say you do use voice control once a day, but it’s only one task. It’s the weather.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What attracts you to using voice control for this purpose, for asking for the weather?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It’s quick. I don’t have to find the app on my phone and I can get the information while still doing other tasks.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Are there other types of commands that you’ve used with Alexa before?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I’ll tell her to play music, set timers, make shopping lists, that sort of thing. Super basic, not a lot of in depth stuff.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And rare as well-</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So it’s weather, which is very useful, and then other things are more sparingly as they pop up, but not part of a habit. Okay, good to know. What stops you from using voice control? You said that OK Google doesn’t really work out. What are some things that frustrate you about that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It’s got a bad voice to text thing. The question I ask won’t always immediately translate into the right text. If I’m driving and I tell it to text someone and say the message I want to send, it doesn’t get it right 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And you don’t want to send weird voice control written messages.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah. I can usually get the gist of the information I want from a voice command. If I ask Alexa the weather, or I’m getting directions from Google Maps, they’ll start talking and I will intuit the information. I will auto-complete it in my brain and I don’t need them to keep talking, and I want them to stop. A lot of the times I’ll tell Alexa to shut up or I will just fume at Google Maps because you can’t tell it to shut up.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s really frustrating. It’s like, “No, I control you, robot.”</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: “You stop when I want you to stop.”</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I want the voice command. Yeah, okay, I get it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: “No more, please.” Like a person. You usually tell a person “stop” and they’ll sometimes listen.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: We don’t want robots in our house that are more stubborn than that. Now I would like to move on to some tasks. I have four tasks, and each task starts with a prompt which is just a scenario to envision yourself in, and then you’re going to be using Alexa to help you in this scenario. Take a moment. I’m going to give you the prompt and read it out to you and then I’m going to unmute Alexa, and whenever you’re ready, say whatever you feel will help Alexa accomplish that task.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Any questions?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: No, I’m good.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, great. I’m actually going to mute that because I say “Alexa.” You are boiling pasta and the instructions say boil it for 10 minutes. Use Alexa to help you keep track of this time.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Alexa: Ten minutes. Starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. Was the feedback that she gave what you expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah, pretty much. I would expect that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You mentioned that you used that task before.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah. That’s one of the tasks I use most often.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Does crafting that phrase feel almost natural to you or is it something that you’ve seen other people do, or you just know, it’s intuitive?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Well, the actual function of the timer … The availability of the timer is not readily apparent unless you are familiar with the Echo. When I first got it, I didn’t know you could set a timer, but once someone showed me, it’s pretty simple and it’s a very direct command, so it’s easy for it to understand and get the correct response back.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. All right, let’s move on to the second task which is, you realize you’re out of salt. Use Alexa to help manage a grocery list. Whenever you’re ready.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, add salt to the grocery list.</p>

<p>Alexa: I added salt to your shopping list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. I know that you know that task because I see you use it. I know that you use it, but do you know … You do know, but do you know other things you can do with the grocery list at all, or where the grocery list lives?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I don’t know any of those things.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes, it goes into the cloud.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah, I assume it ties in with the Echo app and you can manage it through that. I don’t personally have the Echo app on my phone.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Which you guys know by when I turn up the volume and change the music.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It’s so weird that Alexa knows my favorite song is-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Barbie Girl? Or no, DMX?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: DMX.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Wow, you’re going to really like the next task. Moving on. The next task is, you have people over for dinner and it’s too quiet. Have Alexa play your favorite song.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, play DMX.</p>

<p>Alexa: Playing songs by DMX from Spotify.</p>

<p>Chelsea: There we go.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, shut up.</p>

<p>Chelsea: No, not today. There you go. With my almighty power over here. Did that meet expectations of what you want Alexa to do?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And that is something that you are comfortable doing with Alexa?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>

<p>Chelsea: Now, it’s not something you wouldn’t use on your phone because it doesn’t have the capabilities, or you don’t trust the voice?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It’s another situation where Alexa doesn’t get right actually a lot of the time. My suggestion of DMX was pretty broad. She could’ve played anything by DMX and would have been correct, but often times when I want a specific song that I don’t quite know the title of or the artist of, it won’t be able to find it at all, but it will give extremely specific examples of what it can’t find. I’ll say, “Alexa, play Bing Crosby - White Christmas” and it will say, “I cannot find Bing Crosby - White Christmas Greatest Hits 1993,” or whatever.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It’s odd because you never said that.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It’s odd, so it makes me think it’s a flaw in the software.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Because you’re really looking for any Bing Crosby.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah, and it’s leading me to believe that it has found search results and it’s just not executing my command.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, because it heard you, it crafted similar response, and then it just tacked on something else that-</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Made it go all haywire. Awesome. I have one more task for you which is, you’re getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, what’s the news?</p>

<p>Alexa: Here’s your flash briefing. In things to try, know what to expect when you’re heading out. Ask me what’s traffic like right now and I can give you real time travel information-</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Alexa, stop.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Is that what you expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: No.</p>

<p>Chelsea: No?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I’ve never used Alexa to give me hot topics or whatever, so off the top of my head, “Alexa, give me the news” was what I first thought of, and apparently that’s not a command.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What do you think it was doing instead?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: It was trying to narrow down what I wanted by giving me more specific commands. I could’ve listened to the whole menu and then crafted a correct command to get what I wanted, but I don’t know.</p>

<p>Chelsea: If you had to rephrase that maybe, what would you say instead?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: “Alexa, what are recent events? What are the headlines on CNN?” Something like that if I wanted a specific news outlet or whatever. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s when it comes to voice control. I just have some follow up questions for you. What would you say was the easiest prompt to do out of these tasks?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Timer.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Timer, and maybe that’s because you feel more comfortable or you do that a lot?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Yeah. It’s because I do it the most.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What would you say was the hardest phrase to craft?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: Recent events</p>

<p>Chelsea: Why would you say that is?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: I’d never done it before. I didn’t know what Alexa expected for me to get the correct results that I wanted.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What knowledge would you say you did use to finally decide on what to say for getting news?</p>

<p>Interviewee #4: You have to realize how Alexa interprets your words. I have to figure out how specific I need to be. Specific days, specific outlets. That sort of thing.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. Those are all the questions that I have for you. Thank you so much. You’re done at 13 minutes.</p>
