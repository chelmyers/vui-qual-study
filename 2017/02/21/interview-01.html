<p>User distrust the accuracy of VUI. They generally believe they have a low accuracy. This is based on their experience and assume it applies to all other users.</p>

<p>People don’t know what they can say and it takes too long for them to look it up. They rather just use a GUI.</p>

<p>Phrases might be biases off use of Siri.</p>

<p>To-do list is used over grocery list. Is grocery list an unknown feature of Alexa? Do they use to-do list because it something they use already.</p>

<p>User could has just decided to repeat the prompt for task 3.</p>

<p>Perhaps TMI is related to habits. The baseline information is what they are used too. TMI occurs when it is more, or too different that their habit.</p>

<p>After news report is too long with task 4, user think that is their fault and they should have been more specific.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Chelsea: Okay. Awesome. Hi. Thanks for coming. My name is Chelsea and I’m researching voice control right now. I’m going to walk you through what we’re going to do today. Right now, we are currently testing voice user interface or VUIs, to learn as much as we can about the way people use them. Every product is intended to work in a certain way by it’s creators, but as you know the reality might be quite different. The goal of this research right now, like this session, is to get us as close to valuable as possible. This session focuses on how people use voice user interfaces and it is not a test of your skill at all. If something doesn’t make sense it’s a failure of the system, it’s not a failure of you. This session should take about 20 minutes. First I’m going to ask you a few questions about your voice user interface experience and then we’re going to complete some tasks using Amazon Alexa. I have it muted right now, so it can’t hear us and start up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: With your permission I’m going to record this session as well. This will give us a few, a full picture of the session as I record I can look back at the notes. It will not be shared publicly online. Are you okay with this session being recorded?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. Awesome. All right. Now, if you don’t mind I’d like you to sign this invisible permission form and since you don’t have that could you please again say that you give consent?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I give 100% consent that this is recorded.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And your name?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: My name is <strong>* **</strong>.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. Great. Some questions that I have for you. First off is, tell me a little bit about your previous experience with voice user interfaces.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I don’t have too much experience, but I think that I have about an average person’s experience. I have Siri on my cell phone that I use occasionally to set things like timers and alarms and maybe I ask the weather. I also own an Amazon Alexa which is, it’s been fun. I ask about the weather and things like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. How would you define an average person’s use?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: An average person’s use might use I guess voice control maybe once every two days and I would say they are probably pleased with it half the time.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mm-hmm (affirmative) Like a 50% accuracy rate or 50% like understanding.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: It’s probably both. It’s probably both. Sometimes they might be dissatisfied with the accuracy of it and that’s why they stopped using it and then they tried to use it again and they realized, “oh yeah, I forgot why I didn’t use this.” Cause it wasn’t accurate or they forget about it or sometimes they are faster at doing it manually.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Again, how often would you say you use these type of VUIs?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Personally I use them, I actually use them every day to ask the weather in the morning cause I have Alexa. While I’m walking or driving I might use Siri to compose a text.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Excuse me. What attracts you to voice user interfaces? What makes you think of using them in the first place?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: It’s hands free. Which is a big thing so, you can do things like walk around and you don’t have to look down at your phone or while you’re getting ready for the day. Like putting on your clothes or you know, getting your hair done or whatever in the morning. You can ask for the weather. It’s kind of like talking to someone.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What stops you from using voice user interfaces for certain tasks?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I think it’s the, you’re not always sure what you’re able to ask. You know, it’s not like you normally study a glossary of terms that the system knows already so, you have a few things that you know it can do, but in your day to day life you don’t have time to like look it up. By the time you’ve looked it up it’s already time that you could have spent doing it manually. Sometimes you don’t know what you can ask or what it’s capable of doing without spending a lot of time.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Would that be why for a reason you look up the weather on your phone instead of asking Alexa? What causes situations like that where you use a touch screen device over voice?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Sometimes it’s faster. For instance, on my phone all I have to do is you know, swipe left for Apple. I can see a snapshot of the weather. Sometimes if I’m with let’s say, you know I’m in a house that’s quiet, I don’t want to wake up people in the house maybe in the morning with a big voice recording. Not voice recording, but a big speaker. That’s part of it. It’s silent. It’s quick and if, I can check the weather from my bed while I’m in bed before I even get out. Which is nice.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. All right. Great. Now, I have some tasks for you to complete. I’m going to give you a prompt and each prompt is a scenario in which you will use Alexa to help you. After you read or actually in this case you hear the prompt, I’m going to read it for you, craft your phrase and ask Alexa to help you. We’re going to do one prompt at a time. Do you have any questions before we start?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: No. I think I get it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. Awesome. And also I’m going to need to unmute Alexa so, it can hear you. If you could wait until I unmute. That would be wonderful.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. Here’s your first prompt. You are boiling pasta.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Mm-hmm (affirmative)</p>

<p>Chelsea: The instructions say boil it for 10 minutes. Use Alexa to help you keep track of this time.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Alexa: 10 minutes starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. How did you know or what knowledge did you rely on to ask Alexa that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Well, I’ve been preconditioned with Siri. I knew I could do that with Siri and I figured that it has an inner clock I guess so, I knew I wanted to use the word timer and set. Cause you set timers. I intuited it that way I guess.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. Let’s do the second prompt.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. You realize you are out of salt and pepper. Use Alexa to manage a grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Alexa, remind me to buy salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Alexa: I’ve put buy salt and pepper on your to do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Was that action expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Yeah. I guess it was. I’m happy that it put it on my to do list instead of asking me when to remind me. I wonder if I could have said, “remind me tomorrow to buy salt and pepper.” Adding it to my to do list is pretty good. I’m pretty pleased with it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How would you expect to retrieve this to do list?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I guess I’d like to see it on my, added to apps that I already use like if it could add it to my Google calendar or if it could send it straight to my phone. You know, like with a text. That’d be kind of nice or a notification of some kind.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Why did you ask Alexa to remind you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Cause I wasn’t sure whether I could ask it to put it on some sort of like list that I had or whether I had to, I don’t know, ask it to send me a reminder, so I figured it could just remind me. Like ping me or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. Great. Third prompt. You have people over for dinner and it’s too quiet. Have Alexa play your favorite song.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Alexa, play my favorite song.</p>

<p>Alexa: Shuffling your music.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Alexa, stop. That’s not my music. All right. How did you feel about that? Why, how did you craft that phrase?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Well, I think maybe the question you asked implanted a little bit on me. I wasn’t really thinking straight. I would have asked it, too much pressure. Just kidding. I know that from my Alexa I know that it’s connected to Amazon music and I can also connect it to my Spotify. I figured it would take music that it knows I liked from those accounts and either maybe it could pick the metrics of my most played song or songs that I’ve you know, thumbs upped or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. If you had to craft that phrase again, what maybe would you say?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I might, well I if I knew my favorite song of the top of my head, I would ask for it by name. I would say, let’s say it’s Happy Birthday. I’d say, “Alexa, play Happy Birthday.” But if I wanted to hear something that I liked I might say, “Alexa, play me some music that I would like.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. All right. Last part. You are getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up. Do you have any questions about this prompt?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: No, let me just think about how to craft my question for second.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. When you’re ready you can unmute her yourself.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Okay. Okay. I think I’m ready. I’ll unmute it and I’ll ask the question. Alexa, what are the top news stories today?</p>

<p>Alexa: Here’s your flash briefing. In things to try, People caring for family members may find me helpful. Some tasks I can assist with are reading audio books, creating shopping lists and playing music. You can also set up repeating alarms to help remember to do things at a specific time.
	In NPR news from Tune In. Live from NPR news in Washington, I’m Shae Steven.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Stop. I’ll mute it again.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How do you feel about that response you received from Alexa?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: It felt a little long and I wasn’t sure what was happening. Part of it was her cadence was a little slow. It could have been the news story that she happened to choose.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Was the information you retrieved, what you wanted?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Not as quick as I wanted it. I wonder if I could have phrased my sentence to be more pointed like, “Alexa, tell me the political news or tell me the sports news.” Maybe I could have said something like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mm-hmm (affirmative) Again, if you had to rephrase that, what would you maybe do? Say it again.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: That news question?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mm-hmm (affirmative)</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I would say, “Alexa, read me the sports news from today.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. Awesome. I have some follow up questions for you. Out of these tasks, was there any of them that stuck out in terms of difficulty?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: The news one was hard. It’s a little more ambiguous because the subject can vary so much and then she also has to read so much back to you. Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Any others?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: It’s hard to know how to interact with Alexa or voice control when you want to be reminded of something. Cause sometimes you want to be reminded for different reasons you know. Like I’ll actually, I gotta remember to count my calories, but it can also be more specific like, when I’m out tomorrow after work I need to make sure that I don’t forget you know diapers. There’s a lot of variables there so, that one’s hard I think.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What was the easiest prompt to do?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: The easiest one was the music because if I knew my favorite song I could ask for it directly if I wanted to.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you think Alexa knows your favorite song?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Based on my music profiles?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Based off of, whatever you believe.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I think it has access to it and yeah, I’m confident that if I asked for a specific song it could bring one up.</p>

<p>Chelsea: But, your favorite. As in like, does Alexa know?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Does Alexa know my favorite? I think it could guess, but I don’t think it knows unless it was, unless I told it. You know, unless there was some sort of Amazon ranking system that I would have to go manually into the website and say, “this is my favorite song.” Like, I know that you can tell Siri that certain contacts have a certain relationship with you. You can tell Siri like, you know, Ann Smith is my mom. Then when you say, “call my mom”. It, I think it should call Ann Smith.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. It does do that. That’s all the questions I have for you. Do you have anything in general you would like to say about these voice control products?</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: I guess not.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. Awesome. Well, then that you so much for your time.</p>

<p>Interviewee #1: Thank you.</p>
