<p>When laziness is high the chance of using voice control even though the user believes as its lower increases.</p>

<p>User stick to personal assistant tasks because that’s all they see and know.  they feel the most comfortable saying these types of tasks because  because they overhear them a lot.</p>

<p>Grocery list is not familiar for this user so they rely on a way of management that they already know: the to do list.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Interviewee #8: All right.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Oh. What was that time?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: 11:19. What time zone are you in?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Anyway, okay. Now that it’s working, I’m going to start off asking you a few questions about you and your experience. First off, can I ask you how old you are?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: 23.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yesterday, I sent an email and said I was 24 and then I realized that I wasn’t, so that’s why… I’m 23, for the record.</p>

<p>Chelsea: For the record? Well, yeah, what’s wrong with that? I think I’m 22 constantly, but I’m not. I’m just one year older than you, at 24, but I’m also the youngest out of everybody else I know. Okay, moving on to more relevant questions: can I ask you what type of phone do you own?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: An iPhone 5S.. yeah, something like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. With your iPhone 5S or any other devices, do you have any other previous experience using voice control?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What specific programs?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Programs other than Siri? Siri for that. I’ve tried the Microsoft Word dictation, but that was years ago, but that’s really it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It’s within Microsoft Word?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah. I mean, I don’t know if it’s actually part of Microsoft Word or if it was another program. I think it was part of Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome, and what types of tasks do you do with Siri on your phone?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Nothing very well. Sometimes, I ask for the weather and sometimes I’ll get an answer, and, more often than not, it’s like if it’s cold out, I’ll use the voice to text option so that I don’t have to type.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Oh, you don’t have those touchscreen gloves?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I do, but the gloves are too big for my hands and so they don’t really work.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Oh, so it doesn’t end up working? How accurate do you find voice to text?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: It’s hit or miss. Some words, it gets really well, but I can’t think of any of those words off the top, but, sometimes, it’ll very easily mistake a sentence into an entirely different sentence, but then I still have to go back in and erase it and do it by hand.</p>

<p>Chelsea: If it causes errors, why do you choose to try it again and again?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Because it’s cold out. I never really use it unless there is a reason that I don’t want to use my hands for the text, and for weather, again, if my hands are busy, I can click the button and say, “What’s the weather?” instead of scrolling through.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s about it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, that’s about it. If I need my hands for other things.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It might work, so it’s worth the gamble.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Why do you choose not to explore other features within voice interface other than voice to text and weather?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I don’t really know what else there is. I mean, I could probably tell her to open an app, but, at the same time, I could also just click the app icon.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That is true.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah. I feel like it’s only the stuff that I need to do every day that I might use it for, but for specific apps or things that I want to do, I probably wouldn’t think to use voice control.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So the commands that you use are ones you’re familiar with or comfortable?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you know how you first came across these interactions, like seeing somebody else do it or just hit and miss?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I mean, I didn’t have a smartphone for a long time, so I probably saw other people doing it, and then when I got my own, I used to …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. All right. Let me go onto the next section. Next, I have four different scenarios for you, and you’re going to use Alexa here and hold the space bar to ask Alexa to help you out. I’m going to keep making sure it’s recording, because so many times does it stop. It’s okay. With each of the scenario, I’m going to read it out to you. Again, imagine that you’re in it. Whenever you’re ready, hold down space bar and ask Alexa to help you out. If you have any questions about the prompts before you actually speak or use your phrase, you can, of course, ask me, and then we’re going to wait until Alexa gives you your response back. Again, she’s a little slow. Are you ready for your first prompt?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. The first prompt is: you are boiling pasta, and the instructions say to boil it for 10 minutes. Use Alexa to help you keep track of these time. Move that closer to you.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes. I forgot to mention that I just used that –.</p>

<p>Alexa: 10 minutes starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. All right. Did you hear what Alexa said?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: “10 minutes starting now.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes. You also use timer for Siri?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, and is that something you use a lot?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: When you say cooking, that’s the only time that I really use it is when-</p>

<p>Chelsea: When else do we really need timers?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You’re familiar with this command, and I think you said it very confidently.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Alexa set a timer for 10 minutes starting now. Did that meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>

<p>Chelsea: What do you think Alexa’s going to do now?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: She’s going to count down from 10 minutes to zero-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Just patiently waiting.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, great. Let’s move onto the second task, which is: you realize you are out of salt. Use Alexa to manage a grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Alexa, remind me to buy salt.</p>

<p>Alexa: I put, “Buy salt,” on your to-do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, so did that feedback meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I guess. I mean, I wouldn’t expect her to message me when she knows I’m at a grocery store, but that’s probably the closest she could get.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Where do you think this to-do list lives?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: For Alexa, I have no idea. If she was synced with your iPhone or whatever phone you have, I’m guessing it would show up there, but, right now, it’s probably out in the void on somebody’s to-do list, not mine.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mine.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, it’s on your to-do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I need to buy a lot of salt, apparently. Why did you choose to-do list over anything else?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I didn’t consciously pick to-do list. I just didn’t know how she was going to remind me, so I just figured she’d figure something out.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Now, do you use reminders or any type of list tracking on your own?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I don’t use the to-do list. I usually just make my own list in notes or something, because I never check the reminders of the to-do list, but if I can set an alarm to remind myself of something, I’d do that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How do you normally manage your own grocery list?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Now, my dad goes out and buys … no.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s awesome.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Usually, I just write it down in notes, and then I’ll check it off. I don’t usually use the list for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. So you have the upgraded iOS where you do the checklist or you just-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I think it has the checklist, yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. I love that feature. Okay. If you were to rephrase, would you? Or are you confident in-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: If I knew she was linked up with some sort of to-do list on my phone, I’d probably be –</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. There is, also, a grocery list function with Alexa as well, so the to-do list and grocery lists are separate, but either they both go to the same place.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Let’s move onto the next scenario, which is: you have people over for dinner … oh, not that one. I don’t like that one. Okay. Should you wear a jacket today or not? Have Alexa fill you in about your city’s weather.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: What’s the weather?</p>

<p>Alexa: In Seattle, it’s 50 degrees with showers. Today, you can-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: What’s the weather here like?</p>

<p>Alexa: … look for rainy weather with a high of 53 degrees and a low of 42 degrees.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. Did that feedback meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Well, no, because I’m not in Seattle.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You’re not in Seattle, no.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: But I’m assuming, for whatever reason, it’s not synced up with Philly. If it was, then it probably would of.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Is there, maybe, a way you would want to rephrase that question?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I wouldn’t want to rephrase the question, but she could’ve given it to me a little bit snappier, just like, “It’s 62. The low will be whatever.” It felt kind of like she was going through, “Oh, and the wind chill and the dew point … “ I know she didn’t actually go through all that, but for a question like that, I’d rather her just say, “It’s 62 degrees outside.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. How do you normally ask Siri for the weather?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I ask Siri, “What’s the weather?” And then she doesn’t know what I’m saying, so I go into the weather app and I look it up myself.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I thought you said you usually use it.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I use it, but it doesn’t always work.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It doesn’t always work? Oh. I believe, also, Siri doesn’t say anything back; it just presents on list?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, it just presents the list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What’s at the top of the list? It’s like-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: –</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: What’s the weather?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Oh-</p>

<p>Alexa: Okay, here’s the weather today.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, so it doesn’t actually say. It just says –</p>

<p>Chelsea: You changed Siri! It’s British.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Oh, yeah. It’s British.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So it’s just the temperature big at the top, glanceable?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, great. Alexa took a little too long, too much. That is the phrase you say, that is what you use, whether Siri works or not.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Let’s move onto the last task, which is: you’re getting ready in the morning, and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: What’s going on today? She’s probably going to tell me what’s on my calendar.</p>

<p>Alexa: New things to try: know what to expect when you’re heading out. Ask me what’s traffic like right now-</p>

<p>Alexa: … and I can give you real time travel information for you area.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It will come back. I swear, it will. I have faith. I have faith in you, Alexa.</p>

<p>Alexa: In NPR news from TuneIn. Live from NPR News in Washington, I’m Lakshmi Singh. The US is charging two Russian spies and two alleged criminal hackers with carrying out the 2014 cyber attack on Yahoo and-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Stop.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Anyway,… All right. You weren’t confident that Alexa was going to know what you wanted from her. Did she meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: She did, but I feel like if I had things on my calendar, she would’ve started with them, and then she would’ve gone to traffic, and then she would’ve done the news.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So, “What’s going on today?” You feel is more of what’s going on today for you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, that’s what I would assume if this was synced up to whatever account you use.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. Do you know what Alexa was doing? She gave you two responses. Do you know what the first one was?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: The first one was traffic in the area. The second one was just NPR News.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Does that meet your expectations in news?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: In news, it would. I probably should of specified what kind of news I wanted to learn. The only thing about the NPR I didn’t like what that it just went into that first thing, and if I wasn’t interested in that, I wouldn’t feel like listening to the entire thing.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. What would you prefer instead of the sound clip?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: She could read off three or four titles, and then you could pick which one you wanted to hear.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How do you normally get your news?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: The side of Facebook, probably.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s fine. That’s totally okay.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah, either that or … I don’t know, that’s probably it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, and how does that normally look? On the side of Facebook?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: It’s a little list on the side with a two or three-word, usually, tagline to get your interest. Most of it’s nonsense-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Clickbait? Yeah. “Miley Cyrus is a Russian hacker.”</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I don’t get my real news from there. That’s where I usually see news.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You don’t need to defend..</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Then, I have to look it up.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I mean, that’s how people are getting the news nowadays, is through social media. Actually, Facebook cracked down on fake news and it’s a lot better. Clickbait, not so much. Clickbait will be with us, apparently, till we die. Anyway, I have some follow-up questions for you. In general, what was the easiest prompt or the prompt you felt the most comfortable in crafting a phrase for?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: The weather.</p>

<p>Chelsea: The weather, and why would you say that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Because everybody talks about the weather, so we’ve got a lot of practice with it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: The way you ask other people about the weather is the way you would ask Alexa about it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And you believe that she should understand that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>

<p>Chelsea: What was the hardest task for you to figure out –?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Probably current events. I probably could’ve just said the words “current events,” and she would’ve gotten it, but I didn’t.</p>

<p>Chelsea: But you chose to do a more colloquial, friendly kind of way.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Any other reason why you think that was the hardest for you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: No, I think it was just the way I phrased the question.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Last but not least, my final question for you is … actually, I have two more. What do you think about voice control in general? And it’s totally okay if you say, “I hate that and I think it’s crap.” Do not feel biased because I’m working on it, because, sometimes, I hate it.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I don’t hate it. For me, I only use it in specific cases, so it’s not something that I would ever just rely on for everything.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: I mean, it’s interesting. If I had Wi-Fi and my house that could handle Alexa, I probably would have Alexa.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. My Alexa and Nest thermostat hook up. So lazy. It’s literally right there sometimes, and I’m like, “Mmm, change it to 72 degrees.”</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Then, last but not least, do you have any other thoughts or anything in general that you think about Voice User Interfaces? Where do you think they’re going? Do you think they’re going to be incorporated more in your life in the future?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Probably, once I have an actual car, I’ll probably have to use them more for that sort of stuff.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah? So embedded in the car or on your phone..?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Either or. My mom’s minivan has it embedded in the car, and it’s the same hit or misses with the phone, but it’s less distracting, so it’s just the button the dashboard … not dashboard, steering wheel, whereas, with this … I think, in the newer versions, you can just say, “Hey, Siri,” and she’ll hear you, but mine doesn’t, so I have to hold down the button and then wait for it to start.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, so if you have it in your hands already, sometimes … why do voice control when you can just go to it anyway?</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I was worried when you said, “Hey, Siri,” because all of my devices are hooked up-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: All of your devices-</p>

<p>Chelsea: I’m like, literally, one-</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: “Shh, don’t say it.” “Yes?” “Yes?” “Yes?” “Yes?”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Don’t say it. Okay, all right, <em>**</em>. That’s all I have for you. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Interviewee #8: All right.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Let me end this recording. Please be … oh, thank God. It’s still recording.</p>
