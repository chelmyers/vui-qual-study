<p>This user has a programming background and approaches some tasks like they are programs. Meaning he first tries to initiate a protocol and then manipulate within it.</p>

<p>The user does not actually do these tasks themselves to better their lives outside of voice control.</p>

<p>The user is more friendly with their phrases when they believe the phrase is more common. They could be mimicking how they would actually say it to another person as a way to figure out what to say.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Chelsea: Thank you so much for giving me 15 minutes of your life. Which means if I had a card I would give it to you and say you would have 15 minutes of mine. [laughs] You could use that. So what I am looking for, what we are doing right now, is that I’m evaluating how people craft responses when using a VUI. So, a VUI is like Siri or Cortana, and Amazon Alexa as well. Are you familiar with these three? Or have you heard of them</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I kind of familiar with them</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, you know they exist?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I know they exist, I have used like Cortana once or twice. My girlfriend’s sister uses Siri. I know of them.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Ok, so you are exposed. That’s good to know. So, This session should take about 15 minutes. I am going to ask you a few questions about your general experience with VUIs. And then we are going to do four tasks with Amazon Alexa using this simulator. It’s a website. Alexa is a software, or a program you that you can install on pretty much any device so we are using are using this web interface to interact with Alexa. I already have your permission, correct, to record this session?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome. And it would be wonderful if you could state your name for me so I have it on the recording.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: My name is <em>**</em>.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Perfect. Ok great so if I forget your last name I can always go into this recording. Awesome. So first off, do you mind if I ask you how old you are</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: 27, today!</p>

<p>Chelsea: What, it’s your birthday? Facebook didn’t tell me! It told me it’s Jason Kirk’s birthday, but it didn’t tell me it was you. Aw, happy birthday! You got the “…and 3 others” notification on Facebook</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Typical. Typical Facebook.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Not primary. Sorry! We just became friends on Facebook. Happy birthday! You doing anything fun</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: No. I’m here.</p>

<p>Chelsea: No! Aw.. this weekend, next weekend</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I visited with my family this weekend.</p>

<p>Chelsea: There you go, you got some family attention this week at least. Well, happy birthday! That’s awesome. Birthdays are a big deal in my family. I find it so weird when people are like “Meh, you know.” I mean I can get that but my parents, my whole family is like, “BIRTHDAYS.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Ok sorry, but we are going to move on. Again, happy birthday! My next question for you is, what type of phone do you own</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I recently purchased a Nexus 6P.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And you are getting is set up? And everything. I am guessing you haven’t used any of the voice control features on it.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Not yet, but it has a voice to text thing</p>

<p>Chelsea: It has Google Assistant</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Could be?</p>

<p>Chelsea: I think if it’s Android then it comes with Google Assistant</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: It on the Google Fi network thing. So it probably has Google Assistant.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Really you are on Google Fi</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yes</p>

<p>Chelsea: What that is awesome</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: It’s great.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Aw, man. I want it so bad but like iPhone life. Can’t have it. What is your personal previous experience with voice control? Have you ever used a device or program</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: So, are XBox One, we have the Kinect with it, and that has some voice commands that you could use. Other than that, that’s about it. Like I said my girlfriend talks to Cortana sometimes on her laptop.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How often do you use Xbox One Kinect commands</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Well, whenever we use it so 4 times a week.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Four times a week? And what type of commands do you use? I am not familiar, personally, with how to interact with Xbox one via voice</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Well it’s usually like, “Xbox, turn off” or “Go to this app” or “Open Netflix”</p>

<p>Chelsea: And do you find it accurate</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: It’s [long pause] more often than not…it’s accurate. [laughs]</p>

<p>Chelsea: Enough to rely on it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: Enough to rely on it over a remote?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah for the most part</p>

<p>Chelsea: I’m sensing some frustration some of the time</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: It’s not so much of an issue with the voice commands it’s where Xbox lets you use the voice commands. You can use it on the main page to get to an app but once you’re inside the app you have to use a controller.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All that’s interesting. so it’s only useful in one specific…</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  yeah,  but if you’re on your way, if you’re getting up to get the controller and you want to open an app.</p>

<p>Chelsea: that small window</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  that small window</p>

<p>Chelsea: thank God my controller is over here.  I can use a voice command.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  yeah go to Netflix while I turn on the controller</p>

<p>Chelsea: okay well you can also turn it off. Can you do that away from the main page?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  No, you can turn it off from anywhere. So that’s convenient.</p>

<p>Chelsea: But you already have the controller anyway. And with XBox its just hold middle button then off…Yeah, I am PlayStation household so…</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I have been wanting to get one. Persona 5 comes out soon.</p>

<p>Chelsea: We just got, this is not Xbox obviously, but we just got for the Wii U breath of the Wild. It’s beautiful.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That was the only reason I was thinking about getting a Wii U.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah I… the a switch is getting pretty tough reviews, with the way you hold it, like the controllers</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah it’s pretty dumb</p>

<p>Chelsea: it’s the Wii, so as far as pretty dumb controllers go… In some parts of the game they legit make you use the pad. The Wii U pad. The only way you can… We are going to have such a longer… it’s going to be more than 15 minutes if we keep talking about video games.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That’s fine.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And of course the Wii U pad is stashed in the corner of the room so you have to go find it. We never use it unless we got to update something. So it’s like alright, go up and get it. Why? Other  than that it’s beautiful, real cool,  and if you are a Zelda fan there are like nostalgia things in it. The high reviews are not without merit.  Let’s move on. So you are familiar with you said with Cortana because your fiance uses it,  with Xbox control,  Siri from your fiance’s sister,  and any other exposure you would say you had to Voice Control?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I don’t think so, not that I can think of.</p>

<p>Chelsea: all right, that’s totally fine.  it’s what we talked about for the Kinect, you use it when you are getting up and getting the remote control,  why do you choose to use it at all then? Why do you choose to actually use the voice control?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  I guess the novelty of it. And I don’t know, it’s like ever so slightly convenient it’s technically convenient.  It can get us Netflix while we’re looking for the controller so there is a little bit of time saved.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That is true. And what would you say stops you from using voice control on other devices?  You have a Mac, did you upgrade to the latest version?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: No</p>

<p>Chelsea: Well, maybe that’s why you don’t have Siri on your Mac yet. Or other functionality? You just update your devices, so maybe you don’t use voice control because you don’t have it on your devices? But is there anything from your personal opinion that stops you from using voice control?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: So probably because the things that I associate more with voice control are personal assistant type things.  Setting events or calendar updates and things like that. And those are things I don’t really do normally. So I guess I don’t have that need.  If there is something that the voice commands can do for me outside of that I just don’t know.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you typically see people use voice control as a personal assistant?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: Definitely the projects that I’m doing in this room are personal assistants.  And if you don’t need a personal assistant in your life…</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That’s why my fiance is for.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s why she uses Cortana, she needs one. Now I have some tasks for you to complete. I’m going to give you a prompt. Each prompt is a scenario I would like you to imagine yourself in where you’re going to use Alexa to help you. After you hear the prompt take on time to craft your phrase or what you want to say to say to Alexa to accomplish this and then over here is the simulator so I believe you hit spacebar [to start] It does take a little bit for it to get back because the website is a little slow, so it’s not as quick as a Alexa.  But if you are ready we can move on or do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  Uh, sure?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you have any questions?  I’m going to pretty much give you a scenario like do so-and-so and ask Alexa to help you with so-and-so.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Is there anything specific I should know about Alexa?</p>

<p>Chelsea: No because I want see or gauge how people interact with Alexa for the first time.  So you really don’t need to know anything.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: All right.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So you are perfect for this.  Other people I have been asking are around me too much.  or they are like I have Alexa I’m like s***.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: All right.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Again I’m going to testing Alexa I’m not testing you. Any frustration or any confusion that you have is fine and in fact if you can note that to me it will help me more and trying to understand.  now do you want to hear the first prompt?  So the first problem is you are boiling pasta and the instructions say to boil it for 10 minutes, use Alexa to help you keep track of time.  If you have any questions ask me but when you’re ready hold down spacebar to ask Alexa when you want.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  Alex, set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Alexa:  10 minutes starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So is the feedback Alexa gave you what you expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you cook?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you boil pasta?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: yeah</p>

<p>Chelsea: How do you normally keep track of time?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  Microwave timer</p>

<p>Chelsea: Nice.  do you use any other devices or just the microwave?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7:  If we need to set two timers for use a cell phone.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s really how it is.  So you are familiar with setting timers in general on a wide range of devices. Let’s move on to the second one.  You realize you’re out of salt, use of Alexa to manage your grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Alexa, create grocery list. Add salt. [Looks hesitant]</p>

<p>Chelsea: Don’t worry you’re doing fine, also how you feel is how most people feel.</p>

<p>Alexa: Amazon’s choice for salt is salt is $23.71 including tax would you like to buy it?</p>

<p>Chelsea: No! No. Don’t buy $23 worth of salt!</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: The top search for salt for salt is the spice lab’s Himalayan…</p>

<p>Chelsea: Stop. Sorry that’s just the first time that came up.  Someone buying salt.  Did that feedback meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Um,  not quite.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What do you think Alexa was trying to do there?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: It like, I was trying to guide me to Salt it seems.  But just close, but I guess I needed more of a reminder and less of an action.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Would you like to try that again? I am willing.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Sure. Set reminder, buy salt.</p>

<p>Alexa: I’ve added “Buy salt” to your to-do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Right so how did the feedback meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Close, but I guess I needed more of a reminder, less of a …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Action?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So, if you had, would you want to try that again? I’m willing.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Sure.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Alexa. Set reminder buy salt.</p>

<p>Alexa: I’ve added buy salt to your to-do list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, so how did that feedback meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Alexa: That was closer to what I was hoping.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Not spending 23, because that’s actually my account. That’s why I was kind of panicking a minute.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That’s a lot of ….</p>

<p>Chelsea: Did you hear about the commercial thing that happened with Alexa?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: No.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Or, the news report?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Oh, did like …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, so a family, the daughter came home and bought a doll house and Play Doh with Alexa. She just knew how to use it. She’s, I don’t know, like 7? So a local news place reported the story on it and they …</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: And everybody who had an Alexa was …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Bought a doll house! I know … it was like a couple hundred people.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Anyway, all right. So when you changed the way you said it, you did less of an action, more of a word. But did you know that Alexa could actually buy things?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I don’t think that I did. Which makes me, concerns me a little bit.</p>

<p>Chelsea: It does to me as well.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right and do you normally keep a grocery list or some sort of list to keep track of groceries? Or your fiance?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: We usually make a list like pretty much right before we go grocery shopping with just like what we need for the week. But we don’t really keep it running, over the week.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How do you handle that? Pen and paper?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. All right. Let’s move on to the third one? All right. So scenario number three. Should you wear a jacket today or not? Have Alexa fill you in about your city’s weather.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Alexa. What’s the weather?</p>

<p>Alexa: In Seattle it’s 37 degrees with mostly cloudy skies. Today, you can look for rainy weather with a high of 43 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. So did that meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: If I were in Seattle, yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And any thoughts as to why it’s set to Seattle?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That’s probably where the server is for the website. Yeah. I assumed if I had an Alexa it would know my actual location.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. And the information that it gave. Helpful?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. And do you have … So you, if I could make an observation, you asked very colloquially or very relaxed. Hey Alexa, like what’s the weather? So is there a reason maybe why your tone is a little bit friendlier?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Probably because it’s a more common request. So I figured that it would be able to handle it reasonably without too much guidance.
Chelsea: So you felt comfortable? Saying it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. All right. Would you, if you wanted to, would you rephrase that sentence at all, or would you try to change it to figure out your city’s weather?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Sure.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You try it …</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Alexa. What’s the weather in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Alexa: Right now in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania it’s 36 degrees with intermittent clouds. Throughout the day you can expect more of the same, with a high of 52 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. This morning’s freezing. Okay. And last but not least, you’re getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: This is something I very infrequently do … Alexa. What’s in the news?</p>

<p>Alexa: In things to try, check what’s on your shopping list, just by asking me. If there’s something you’ve forgotten, I can add it for you. Then, see the list on your Alexa app when you’re on the go. You’ll never forget a thing.</p>

<p>Alexa: In NPR News from Tune-In. Live from NPR News in Washington, I’m Giles Snyder. A senior law enforcement official has confirmed to NPR that FBI director James</p>

<p>Chelsea: Stop. You’re … So did that feedback match what you were expecting?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I wasn’t so much expecting the information about my live reminders and stuff.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And so what about what followed, NPR?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That was fine. I mean NPR is good, obviously. It’s not a problem with NPR, but I was expecting more of just like a list of headline kind of things as opposed to what may have been a full story or at least a reading or blurb from that story.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So how do you normally browse news?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I don’t.</p>

<p>Chelsea: No? How do you … all right. How does news come to you?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Uh, through my fiance I guess.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah? You’re in a bubble?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Very much yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s, most of my news right now comes on when my fiance turns on several of his news channels and I absorb it just being next to him.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I’ll catch like two or three minutes before Jeopardy.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: That’s about the extent of it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So nothing on your phone, no social media feeds …</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah, I guess on Social Media as people are posting things I’ll see it, but not really look at it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. All right. So that’s it with the tasks. I just have some follow-up questions for you. What would you say was the easiest prompt to do out of the four?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: The weather one.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I think because it’s something that I actually … It’s something that I look for, so it’s, I don’t know, it was something I had to think about less.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Mm-hmm (affirmative). What was the hardest one for you to do?</p>

<p>Chelsea:  Or the one you felt … I guess hardest is a weird question … You felt was uncomfortable. Or least secure –</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I guess the news. The news one took me the longest to think about what to ask.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Did any of these functionalities surprise you or were they things you didn’t know Alexa could do?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Ordering salt was …</p>

<p>Chelsea: I have done this a few times and no one has yet ordered anything on my machine, especially not $23 salt. That’s salt!</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Maybe it’s just like a 40 pound bag of salt.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I ordered a pound of Rosemary once. I still have it. It’s frozen in my freezer. Anyway. It happens. So the news one, okay. And you don’t browse for news at all, outside of voice control.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So what are some comments you have or thoughts about voice control in general? Where do you see it going or what do you despise about it? Some people just hate it.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: So it’s … I think it’s fine. It’s a good hands free option for doing things that can be done well. I think the biggest problem that voice control things have to overcome is that people are going to get very frustrated if they ask something that they think is obvious or that they think should be clear and the voice control system doesn’t think so or it gives them something that they’re not expecting. Because when you’re doing it with text it’s very easy to, because you’re doing it with text, I think you type it in a less natural way or you do it in such a way that you know you’re talking to a machine as opposed to if you’re just talking with your voice you might do it more casually which could be an issue.</p>

<p>Chelsea: So when confidence meets frustration it can create animosity?</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. It would suck to be like, “Hey Alexa, what’s the weather?” And Alexa’s like, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” You’re like …</p>

<p>Chelsea: And like you said, there’s no filter. When you type or use a keyboard, you’re putting something in between a translation, which you’re like … all right I know what you’re about, I know what I’m about, we’ll work this together.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: I’m going to try to put it in a way that you can understand and since I’ve been, since working with the Xbox, when we first got it … I guess it would be the opposite for me. When I first got it, I was like, very much like Xbox. Turn. Off. Enunciating very much and trying very hard to make sure that it understood what I was saying. But now more and more I’m like, Xbox turn off. Nothing. Xbox turn off. Xbox turn off.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: So it’s I don’t know, I guess it can go both ways.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. A little bit of laziness meeting … I do have a Nest thermostat connected to my Alexa and you can control it. “Alexa, family room 85.” Or, not 85, God, I don’t want to live on …</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Live on the sun.</p>

<p>Chelsea: 75. And she’ll be like, don’t understand, Room … I’m like, family room. Don’t understand, fun room. But I still won’t get up. “Alexa. Family Room.75” Okay great. So that’s all I have for you. Here this is for you. This is just 25 minutes … cuz yeah, it did get … 27. But … I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Interviewee #7: Rounded …</p>

<p>Chelsea: It only ever took 17 minutes. You just had to bring up video games and bought 23 … you are like the twelfth person, too. So, of course you’re the one who I promised the most would take the last time and that’s what happens. Every time I say it’s only 13, 15 minutes, it goes up by two minutes.</p>
