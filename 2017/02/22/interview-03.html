<p>User has no desire to use VUIs and believes touch is always faster.</p>

<p>User wants to talk more conversational while in public. Are people more curt when speaking to a VUI alone?</p>

<p>Once the user knows a new command, he may look for easier ways to say it.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Chelsea: Wonderful, wonderful. If you could first start off with stating your name for me and saying I have permission to record you.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: This is *** and I am allowing this to be recorded.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome, great. What we’re going to be doing today is we’re going to be testing voice user interfaces and talking a little bit more about them. As you know most every product has an intended use, but in reality a lot of them don’t live up to standards. The purpose of this testing is trying to see where voice interfaces are struggling and where they’re succeeding as well. What I’m focusing on is if there’s any failures of the system. It’s no way any failures of you. If you’re confused or frustrated, it’s not you at all, it’s a failure of the system. This session will take about 15 minutes. I’m going to ask a few questions about voice interfaces and then I’m going to have you complete four tasks. Do you have any questions so far?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Nope.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, awesome. My first question is, let me set up my notes real quick. Go, I’ll write in pink for you, there we go, *** . Tell me what is your previous experience with voice control like Cortana and Siri and Alexa right here?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Very little.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What systems have you used and in what ways?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I’ve only casually used Amazon Alexa or Amazon Echo, whatever the official name is, at friend’s houses, but I don’t own any actual devices that use voice commands. Well let me rephrase that. My phone can use voice commands but I don’t utilize them.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Have you ever used it at all on your phone?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Occasionally I’ll use it just to play music or something off of my phone, but other than that I don’t use voice texting. I don’t use any other commands. That I don’t even know what they would be.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How would you, how many times would you say you do use voice control per week, per month, per year?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: You know, once or twice a month, if that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, great. What would you say stops you from using these voice devices, or on your phone, or purchasing one in general?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Well pretty much the most overriding reason is really just that I don’t need it, or at least I don’t feel like I need it. I don’t need an Amazon Echo because I don’t, based on what I know of it’s functionality, I don’t feel like I need any of it or want it for me personally.</p>

<p>Chelsea: With your phone?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I just, other than voice to text texting, which I assume my phone can do. I haven’t actually ever tried it even, but I just would rather type out what I want to say because it’s faster just by muscle memory of typing by this point.</p>

<p>Chelsea: When you do use voice control on your phone or with Alexa, what are your reasons behind it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: At this point mostly just out of curiosity or testing how it works but not really because it’s easier or anything like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Is it the same for when you play music on your phone?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Sometimes when I play music on my phone it’s just because I don’t feel like typing in the artists name or the album or something like that. In that case it would be because it’s easier, but the limitations are that I can only search in Google Play music, which means that I have to own the music that it searches for. As far as I know I can’t search You Tube or I can’t search other functions. Maybe I haven’t set it up properly or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I’m going to begin with the tasks. I have four for you. I’m going to give you a prompt and the prompt is a just a scenario that you’re going to envision yourself in. You’re going to hear the prompt and you’re going to draft a phrase to have Alexa help you out with it. We’re going to do one prompt at a time. Do you have any questions?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: No.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, all right, great. When I’m done saying the prompt I’m going to unmute Alexa because it’s kind of annoying with her listening constantly, and then whenever you’re ready you can say whatever you feel you need to say to accomplish the task.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, so the first prompt is, you are boiling pasta and the instructions say to boil it for 10 minutes. Use Alexa to help you keep track of this time.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Alexa …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Sorry go on.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Alexa, set … are you still listening I can’t tell, the light is freaked out. Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Alexa: Ten minutes starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Did that match your expectations of what Alexa would do?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Pretty much.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How did you know how to Alexa to do that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I figured that the more straight forward the command would be, so if you want something to set a timer, set a timer for 10 minutes, is really the most straight forward I figured you could get without sounding like an idiot.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Have you used …</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Create timer 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: …Google search.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Have you used that type of function with voice control before?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Not really. I’ve seen other people use it but I haven’t.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, let’s move on to the next prompt. Next prompt is, you realize you are out of salt, use Alexa to manage a grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Alexa, start a grocery list.</p>

<p>Alexa: What should I add?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Salt.</p>

<p>Alexa: I’ve added salt to your shopping list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You sounded a little surprised there. Tell me about that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Well it’s based on the fact that everything that I say has to be programmed for it to be able to respond to. I assume that start a list or a note or something would be a function, but it didn’t know if it would recognize the word grocery.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Did it’s feedback match what you were expecting?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Yeah. I’m glad that it clarified that it’s, well I also liked that it immediately said, “What should I add?” Instead of just ‘All right, I made a grocery list’ and then me having to say separately, “All right, add salt to my grocery list.”</p>

<p>Chelsea: Why did you chose to ask to start a grocery list? Instead of just saying another phrase instead like, automatically saying add pepper.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I don’t know, I assumed that if I said, “Add salt,” with no context that it wouldn’t necessarily know what I was talking about. Plus I wanted to make sure that I knew that it was doing what I was wanting it to do, rather than just assuming. I didn’t want to just say, “Add salt,” and then have to like back track because it didn’t work or something like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Where did you think this grocery list lives?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I assume that there’s some sort of account linked to my Amazon account, linked to the device or something like that, and that there’s cloud storage associated with my Amazon account in some manner.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You’d be right with that. If you were to rephrase that, or would you ask, would you, or would you ask the question the same way.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Ask Alexa the same thing?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I mean I guess I would just see what happens if I said, if I was just testing it out for the first time, I would probably just say ‘create a list,’ or something. Or ‘create a shopping list’ instead of a grocery list and see if it needed to be a simpler command, or a more general command, I mean, not necessarily simpler, but less specific just in case it didn’t get that detailed.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you manage any grocery lists, or shopping lists, or lists at all yourself with tools in your smartphone or on your computer?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: I basically just have, use Google Keep to create notes and reminders for some things.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: But I manually type all of those.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What is your process when you’re creating something with Google Keep?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Well I have to open the app and then I either find an existing note such as ‘To do’ or like ‘stuff to do for my class’ or something like that, and then just continue adding things onto the already existing list.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, awesome. Third question, or prompt. You have people over for dinner and it’s too quiet, have Alexa play your favorite song. You can take time to think of these if you want to or you could just…</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Do I have to actually play my favorite song?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah. Play your favorite song.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Cool, I see. Alexa, play Crystal Skull by Mastodon.</p>

<p>Alexa: Crystal Skull by Mastodon from Spotify.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, so was that response appropriate?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Yeah, I mean that was the correct song. Although I didn’t know immediately if it would be able to find it because I didn’t know, A: if it was going to be looking just on Spotify or B: if it would hear me saying the name of the track or the artist correctly.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Is the way you crafted that response similar to the way you ask your phone to?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Yeah pretty much. I mean there are some times where I doesn’t work, or it will start playing like a Google Radio version instead of the copy that I actually own in my library or something like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right, good. We have one last prompt and it is, you are getting in the morning and you want to hear current events, have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Alexa, tell me some current events.</p>

<p>Alexa: Here’s your flash briefing.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Wow sounds official.</p>

<p>Alexa: And things to try and make a great kitchen companion. I can help with conversions like how may teaspoons in a tablespoon or how many pints in a gallon. Your dinner guests will be very impressed. In NPR news from TuneIn.
Speaker 4: Live from NPR news in Washington, I’m Jack Spear. The Trump administration is rescinding a public guidance for public schools</p>

<p>Chelsea: Alexa, stop. Did that meet, was that something you were expecting or how did that …</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Well I was slightly confused because it started telling me features of it, as a product, which I really didn’t expect it when I was asking for current events. Maybe, I don’t know, I just didn’t consider that to be a current event. Apparently there’s some sort of feature called Flash, News Flash or something, I forget what it said, which I didn’t know that was an official feature. And I also didn’t expect it to start just playing NPR. I thought it was going to give me a list of important headlines or something. Not necessarily, literally just start playing the most popular NPR article or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Why do you think you would expect headlines or just titles of, or summaries of…</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: That’s just semantically or whatever you want to use, casually just current events usually means like important news and not really getting into the details. Like if I said, the Syrian War is a current event, but I don’t want to like have every …blow by blow explained to me before I hear any other headlines or something like that.</p>

<p>Chelsea: If you had to ask that again or rephrase it, what would you might say?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Maybe ‘give me top news headlines for today’ or ‘what’s going on in the news’ or something like that just to see if that makes it approach it differently or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, so that’s it for tasks. I have a few follow up questions. First of all, what prompt did you find the easiest to do and why?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: To be honest the grocery store one is probably the easiest. When I think of asking a computer essentially, to do something I usually associate that with simple management tasks more than like necessarily having a conversation, quote, unquote, telling me the news or stuff like that. I don’t know asking a voice control thing to make me a list or a timer, it’s seems more suited to a computer thing.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay. What would say was the hardest task or the most difficult to think of a way to say?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Well I mean I guess the news was the most difficult because it could be asked, that type of question could be asked in a lot of different ways, and unless you have a manual or something to know what to say in advance it might not be clear. I mean the music one wasn’t hard, but again, if you’re asking for a specific song or a specific artist that is pronounced, that’s like weird sounding or something, then it might be tedious to try to get it to recognize what you’re saying. Not that mine was but …</p>

<p>Chelsea: Do you have any extra comments or thoughts about voice control in general, like how do you think it’s going to be incorporated into our lives in the future?</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Oh is that the ten minute timer? From before?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yep.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: What was I going to say? I guess I’d assume more things that already exist will have it added into them, like car consoles, I don’t know, just every day electronic items that might need commands but don’t have voice commands currently, but I don’t really foresee that many products dedicated solely to voice stuff like Echo, are there even any other ones?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Google Home.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Oh yeah, Google Alexa.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah, that’s about it.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: But maybe not, this one might be a dumb example, but add it into a microwave as a thing rather than making a new device.</p>

<p>Chelsea: To manage your microwave.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Okay, all right. That’s all I have for you. Thank you so much for doing this. You can now go watch Batman.</p>

<p>Interviewee #3: Hooray. Cool.</p>
