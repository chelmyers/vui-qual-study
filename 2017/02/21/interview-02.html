<h2 id="memos">Memos</h2>
<p>User will use GUI over VUI is the device has a screen and is already in hand. Why is this? Is it a trust issue? User notes they do not what to disrupt what they are currently doing.</p>

<p>Bias from assuming Alexa has same features as Siri.</p>

<p>When using commands that are new, users are delighted when it works.</p>

<p>Alexa actually never turned on for first attempt at task 3. User missed this since they were not looking at Alexa. User assumed Alexa did not understand his phrase then.</p>

<p>When VUI fails, user often think they need to be more specific to get it to work.</p>

<p>User believes news should presented like headlines. This is also how he reads it habitual right now.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Chelsea: Hello. Hello, <em>**</em>. Thank you for coming in. My name is Chelsea. I’m a researcher for Voice User Interface and I’m going to walk you through a session today. Before we start, I have some more information for you about what we’re doing.</p>

<p>Chelsea: We’re currently testing voice user interfaces of VUI’s like Siri, Cortana, Alexa to learn as much as we can about the way people use it. Every product is intended to work in a certain way by it’s creators but, as you know in reality, it doesn’t always mean that’s how people perceive it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: The goal of this research is to get our product as close to the reality as possible. This session focuses on how people use VUI’s and it’s not a test of your skills at all. If something doesn’t make sense, it’s a failure of the system, not a failure of you.</p>

<p>Chelsea: This session will take about 15 minutes. I’m going to ask you a few questions and then I’m going to have you complete some tasks with Amazon Alexa that I have it muted right now so she doesn’t listen to us.</p>

<p>Chelsea: With your permission, I’m going to record this session via audio and I wanted to make sure that I have your permission to do this so if you could please state your name is let me know if I have consent.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: My name is *** and you have consent from me.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Thank you.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Am I being recorded right now like we did?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay. Just making sure.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great! I’m asked to record. It will give us the full picture of this session when we look back onto it in the future. We’re not going to share these recordings outside with any team of people who are working on-</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay, cool.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great! Now I would like to ask you a few questions. The first one is, what is your previous experience with voice control?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I just use Siri and then I sometimes use Alexa.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What are the tasks that you do with Siri and with Alexa?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I mainly just ask Siri to set an alarm and then for Alexa, I just ask her to put on a song.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How familiar would you say you are with these types of voice control systems?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I guess I’m familiar in that I know that they exists but I’m not familiar with the extent of what I could do with them.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How often, maybe, would you say you use them per week?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Siri, I use pretty much every night.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And Alexa?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Alexa is only when I’m visiting you.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What attracts you to doing these tasks with voice control in the first place?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: For using Siri, it’s easier to, I guess, instead of having to press everything and also if I’m already about to go to bed, I’d rather not look at a screen. It’s just convenient that I can set an alarm that way. For Alexa, I guess since she’s already hooked up to play music, it’s easier than trying to go through a playlist and find a song or just YouTube it or something.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What would you say stops you from using voice control? Why might you set an alarm with using your smartphone, using touchscreen, or playing music manually instead of using voice?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: If Siri doesn’t have enough battery so on low battery mode you can’t talk to her and maybe if I’m already using my phone and as I … “Oh yeah, I should probably just set an alarm,” so instead of stopping what I’m doing to do the voice command, I’d just rather do it manually. For Alexa, it’s convenient and I guess it’s a good way to announce to the room because when I use Alexa, it’s mostly because I’m with other people. It’s a good way to announce what song you’re about to play and you can put on a stupid face when you finish the sentence.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I now have some tasks for you to do. I’m going to give you a prompt, a task, and each prompt is a scenario in which you will use Alexa to help you. It’s a pretend scenario. After you hear each of these prompts, I would like you to craft a phrase and ask Alexa to carry it out.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: We’re going to do one prompt at a time and whenever you are ready to speak to Alexa, just click the unmute button right here and then you can talk to her. Your first prompt is you were boiling pasta and the instructions say to boil it for 10 minutes. Use Alexa to help you keep track of this time.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay. I’m ready.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Oh yeah. I didn’t have to say that. Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Alexa: 10 minutes. Starting now.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great! Okay. What knowledge do you use or how did you feel comfortable with using that phrase?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Super comfortable.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yeah?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Because I know, I guess these voice commands or what was it BUI’s-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Voice User Interfaces. Yes, VUI’s.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I guess are they able to keep track of time so I’m aware of that and it’s pretty comfortable for me to say set a timer or set an alarm so anything regarding time is pretty comfortable to create a command for.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You trusts that the system can actually carry those out?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome! Let’s move on to the second task. You realize you are out of salt and pepper. Use Alexa to manage a grocery list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Whenever you’re ready, unmute her.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: What am I missing again? Eggs?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Salt and pepper. Alexa, add salt and pepper to a grocery list.</p>

<p>Alexa: I put salt and pepper on your shopping list.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Hell yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great! Did Alexa do what you expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: All right. Where do you think this grocery list lives?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I have no idea. I’ve just seen you use it but I have no idea where it goes to. I’m guessing that it’s attached to someone’s phone or it just makes a document. Maybe she has an app. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes, that would be correct. It does go to an application that you can check in. Would you say you crafted that sentence then because it is something you’ve seen me do or … Yeah?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yeah. Otherwise, I would have no idea that … I had no idea that I might be able to ask Siri to put something or write a note. That’s from, I guess, indirect use of Alexa.</p>

<p>Chelsea: There was some hesitation in your prompt as well. Is that you were just hoping you were saying it right? What was that slight pause?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: When?</p>

<p>Chelsea: You’re like … What you said. You were, “Alexa, add salt and pepper to my grocery list?” You went up a little bit in your… Was it just you weren’t sure it would work?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: She repeated the phrase shopping list and I said grocery list because I wasn’t sure if … I guess it was like, “Is this the right terminology to use,” or just, I guess, repeating what the prompt was asking.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. Prompt number three. You have people over for dinner and it’s too quiet. Have Alexa play a song.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yo Alexa, play some party vibes. I guess that didn’t work.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You want to try again?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Alexa, play some happy tunes.</p>

<p>Alexa: Christmas Cocktails from Spotify.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Okay.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Alexa, stop.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Actually, that’s not too bad. That sounds pretty classy.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Did Alexa do what you expected?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Kind of. She started playing music. I was expecting her to play music but I was hoping that my initial command would’ve been picked up. It was just…</p>

<p>Chelsea: If you had to rephrase that, how would you say it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: The yo, Alexa one?</p>

<p>Chelsea: This prompt. Yeah.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Like a task?</p>

<p>Chelsea: No. How would you-</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: If I had to talk to Alexa again, what would I say?</p>

<p>Chelsea: To play, yeah.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I’d probably specify it like a genre so I don’t end up with Christmas music.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes. Why don’t we try that again? Why don’t you ask Alexa to play your favorite song?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Hey Alexa, play some disco.</p>

<p>Alexa: Disco from Spotify.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Hell yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Alexa, stop. All right. Awesome. Was that a little closer to what you were expecting?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yes.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. Now we’re on to the last prompt. You are getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events. Have Alexa catch you up.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: All right. Alexa, what’s happening in the world?</p>

<p>Alexa: Here’s your flash briefing. In things to try, did you know you can send feedback at any time through the Alexa app? Just go to the “help in feedback” section and share your thoughts at any time. In NPR News from TuneIn …
Shay Stevens: Live from NPR News in Washington, I’m Shay Stevens. President Donald Trump is denouncing recent threats against Jewish community centers.
Pres. Trump: The anti-sematic threats targeting our Jewish-</p>

<p>Chelsea: Stop. Did that meet your expectations?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Not quite.</p>

<p>Chelsea: How’s so?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: I guess I was looking for more briefings as in “Here’s a list of stuff that’s happened,” and it would just give me headliners and then maybe if I there was a topic that intrigued me, I would be like “Hey Alexa, find out more on … “ and then the name of the headline.</p>

<p>Chelsea: That’s how you would ask about a specific news event? Correct?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yeah. If I want to specify but if I just wanted to find out what was kind of going on like the highlights so it’s not like I would care about every single thing going on but maybe some things catch my interest like I guess currently in my iPhone if I swipe to the left from the home screen, I just have a newsfeed of just stuff that’s happening and then there’s also just “Seven Things You Need to Know for Your Monday” type stuff.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Great. I have just some followup questions for you. First of all, did any of these tasks feel more difficult than the others?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: No. I think it was not difficult. It was just different comfort levels. It’s just I know that I can play music but I guess in terms of asking for something to be added to a grocery list or finding out current events, those were things that for the most part I haven’t asked any VUI to do for.</p>

<p>Chelsea: What prompt would you say was the easiest to do and why?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Just setting a timer because, again, I was just familiar with it.</p>

<p>Chelsea: You felt comfortable doing that?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: But that just means you do it every day.</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yes. I do it every day.</p>

<p>Chelsea: I have no more questions for you. Do you have any comments in general about voice control that come to mind when you think of it?</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Do these things normally come with instruction manuals and what you can ask of is that something you’d find by yourself because … ?</p>

<p>Chelsea: Yes! They normally do. Alexa, for example, has an app and a paper manual. Siri has a list, a command list you can bring up and you can check out. I don’t know about Microsoft’s Cortana or Google, Okay, Google but do normally they come with some type of visual way to help or a audio training tutorial as well. Alexa, actually in the getting news event was like, “this is what’s new with me.” It takes a while to get to actual news. It could be a detriment because she’s like, “This is what’s new with Alexa skills,” and it’s not really what you asked for-</p>

<p>Interviewee #2: Yeah, that was kind of weird. I initially was excited because I thought she understood the command and I was kind of thrown off when she started talking about this is stuff that I can do when you can refer to the app to figure out more. That’s not what I thought. But yeah! Not really any other questions with VUI.</p>

<p>Chelsea: Awesome! Then that is all.</p>
