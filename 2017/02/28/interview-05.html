<p>User was not confident at first with the phrase that a rationalized why it did end up working.</p>

<p>The user didn’t accomplish the task at first for task number to but did get information from the voice user interface. She use that information to craft her next response.</p>

<p>This interview the user use last conversational phrases and talked to the voice user interface more like it was a machine. This might be because of her programmer background.</p>

<p>The user gets more blunt with the last task perhaps this is confidence or lack of confidence. Does she use more machine like phrases when she isn’t sure what to say?</p>

<p>User has no current news habits this might be why the last task phrase is very vague.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Chelsea: It is ok if I record this? Because I am.
 
Chelsea: Awesome. So thank you so much for letting me do this. This will be quick. I’m not going to go tell you my name, you know it. What I’m doing is I’m testing it in voice user interfaces like Siri and Alexa. I have a simulation of Alexa here because she doesn’t like this Wifi. To put it simply. It will take 15 minutes. I’m going to ask you some questions first about your experience with voice user interfaces and your thoughts on them. And then I have four tasks in which prompts to talk to Alexa for you to execute. So I’m trying to measure how people create these comments. So there’s four commands for you to actually use.
 
Chelsea: When we get there this is actually pretty cool you can like hold space bar and say, “what is the weather” And it acts just like Alexa. Its a little slow.
 
Alexa: Right now in Seattle it’s 39 degrees with.
 
Chelsea: Stop. So there it is. So we get there, whenever you’re ready to speak to Alexa, press space bar.  First, I have some questions for you. So first part is, is if you could tell me your name and tell me if it is if you give permission for me to do this recording so I have it on tape.
 
Interviewee #5: OK. So my name is *** And yes you can record it.
 
Chelsea: Perfect, ok, I have it forever. All right. Awesome. And you are mind me asking, can I ask how old are you?
 
Interviewee #5: Twenty three. I thought for a second.
 
Chelsea: I’ve legit… I’m 24 and yesterday I was like I’m 22.
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah, I’m like wait hold old am I?
 
Chelsea: Ok, Awesome. And I’m also going be taking notes so I know that what I have recorded. Can I also ask what type of phone do you own?
 
Interviewee #5: I have a Samsung S… 7? 7, right now.
 
Chelsea: Two more with voice control questions. What is your previous experience so far with voice user interfaces?
 
Interviewee #5: Well, um, Oh I usually just use them just to like mess around. But like rarely ever.
 
Chelsea: Yeah?
 
Interviewee #5: So, yeah.
 
Chelsea: OK. Awesome. What types of system have you used or what do you mess around with?
 
Interviewee #5: I’ve tried it on like a phone, not my phone. I don’t know if I mean I guess it has like googling something.
 
Chelsea: Google assistant?
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah yeah yeah. So I haven’t tested it on my phone. I like playing around with other people’s like Siri or something.
 
Interviewee #5: So I guess that is really the only one that I like tried.
 
Chelsea: And you never use it on your phone?
 
Interviewee #5: Mmm-mmm (no).
 
Chelsea: Awesome. OK.
 
Chelsea: So I guess, how familiar would you say you are with voice? This might be because your exposure with Anushay’s work and my work.
 
Interviewee #5: Um, I am not totally familiar. I just mess around and like I hear the things that like, like, some voice interfaces say back but like that’s it. I don’t know any actual commands that are useful.
 
Chelsea: Do remember any type of commands that you have used you so far?
 
Interviewee #5: Umm… no.
 
Chelsea: No? It’s in the moment, kinda?
 
Interviewee #5: It was like a joke thing. Like, “Oh yeah let’s say this and see what she says.”
 
Chelsea: Have you seen Lego Batman?
 
Interviewee #5: No, aha.
 
Chelsea: No one is a much as a child as I am! Of course I saw Lego Batman.
  He’s like, ah, he calls his computer, “Hey ‘puter”. Just ‘puter. And Siri has if you say, you know, “Hey ‘puter” to it, it responds like you’re Batman.
 
Interviewee #5: Ohhhh. yeah exactly yeah yeah.
 
Chelsea: Awesome. And so you say that you use VUIs, almost never.
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah.
 
Chelsea: OK great. What stops you from using, uh, VUIs?
 
Interviewee #5: Umm, definitely reliability. Like because I don’t trust it to do things so I just do it myself.
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah that’s pretty pretty much the only reason I guess.
 
Chelsea: Is it because it doesn’t know it doesn’t understand what you’re saying or can’t do what you want to do?
 
Interviewee #5: Umm, I think multiple reasons like maybe it can’t do all I want to do and it’s not readily, like it’s not telling me what I can like say so I don’t know how to use it. So, I don’t like bother. Yeah.
 
Chelsea: It’s like you don’t think, “Oh” like, “Oh I know I can play, like, I need to play music.”
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah. So I’ll just do it. Yeah I’m going to Google to do it and then it doesn’t do it. So I’m like OK.
 
Chelsea: Yes. That makes sense. Like I have this concrete method.
 
Chelsea: OK great. So now I have some tasks for you to complete. I’m going to give you a prompt to read it out loud. And then after you hear the prompt, I want you to craft the way that you think that Alexa can execute that for you. So there’s scenario, a scenario for each, and then after I say it, you know take your time whenever you’re ready, hold down spacebar while you’re speaking. Say the prompt and then it will say “processing”. All right. Awesome, so your first prompt is you are boiling pasta and instructions say to boil it for 10 minutes use Alexa to help you keep track of time.
 
Interviewee #5: OK um, Alexa set a timer to 10 minutes. I don’t know if that does anything.
 
Alexa: 10 minutes, starting now.
 
Chelsea: So did that, result meet your expectations?
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah.
 
Chelsea: Yeah? Um, and uh, how would you normally handle this task? In the, say, in the real world without voice control.
 
Interviewee #5: I would just go into my phone and bring up the timer, or the clock app and just set it.
 
Chelsea: So how did you know, how did you know to ask for a timer function for Alexa? Because it’s just.
 
Interviewee #5: I don’t know. I think it might also have to do with my coding background too. Like I know that like I set certain things to just be like a timer. I don’t know.
 
Chelsea: It’s a phrase you’re familiar with.
 
Interviewee #5: It just feels like the right thing to say.
 
Interviewee #5: Especially when talking to a computer.
 
Chelsea: Yeah, you must have it! Yes you’re all just clocks. Complicated clocks.
 
Chelsea: OK great. So let’s move on to the second one. Um, you realize you are out of salt and pepper. Use Alexa to manage your grocery list. Again if you have any questions ask me. When you are ready, give is a twirl.
 
Interviewee #5: OK. So I’m managing a grocery list that I already have, right? OK.
 
Interviewee #5: Uhhhhhh, shoot.
 
Chelsea: It’s totally ok!
 
Interviewee #5: She’s going to be like…what?
 
Chelsea: I work with this every day.
 
Interviewee #5: OK. All right. Manage grocery….list. No. that’s not going to work.
 
Chelsea: Let’s see.
 
Chelsea: This simulation is going to kill me.
 
Alexa: You Have 14 items on your shopping list. Here are the five most recent.
 
Interviewee #5: Ahhh, OK. OK.
 
Chelsea: OK anyway, so it stopped.
 
Interviewee #5: Ok, so I need to, what was the prompt again, I need to…?
 
Chelsea: Add salt.
 
Interviewee #5: Add salt. Add salt to grocery list?
 
Alexa: I’ve added salt to your shopping list.
 
Interviewee #5: Ohh, I like that.
 
Chelsea: Where do you think the shopping list lives?
 
Interviewee #5: Who knows? In the cloud?
 
Chelsea: That’s correct, actually! Yeah, well this is actually my personal shopping list. It’s like how much, it has a lot of salt on it now.
 
Interviewee #5: Add salt. Add salt. Add salt.
 
Chelsea: But yes it does live on the cloud. So I if I can ask, why did you ask to manage grocery list first?
 
Interviewee #5: Mmmm, because I guess I just didn’t know what to say so I was just going to see if she could pick that up because I don’t know manage it just seems like a word the computer might understand.
 
Chelsea: Its kind of like starting a program, boot grocery list.
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah yeah yeah yeah like trying to speak in words the computer might understand.
 
Chelsea: Yeah. So if you had to say this again or create the phrase again would you say differently?
 
Interviewee #5: I think now I might just say at so-and-so to grocery list because I know she can be that now, so.
 
Chelsea: Nice, um, how do you handle this task normally? If you’re managing your grocery list.
 
Interviewee #5: Um, so I have many many apps. That I make the lists on. Like it goes from Likes sticky notes on my computer to like Wunderlist which I love.
 
Chelsea: I forget we are Wunderlist sisters!
 
Interviewee #5: So usually just go to my shopping list in Wunderlist and put it like it a subtask.
 
Chelsea: Awesome, I love Wunderlist. Not enough to pay for it though.
 
Interviewee #5: Ahaha, right. The sad reality.
 
Chelsea: All right, so the third question is… all right, so the third prompt is, its actually..ok…You have people over for dinner. It’s too quiet. Have Alexa play some music.
 
Interviewee #5: Ummm, play…. music? I dont’ know, should I think of like a song…?
 
Chelsea: You can!
 
Alexa: Amazon Music is not supported for this device.
 
Interviewee #5: So yeah if it was supported.
 
Chelsea: Yeah, exactly, but that.
 
Chelsea: Just so you know that phrase would work and what it would do is it would like randomly say “We think you like this music…”
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah it would just shuffle some more songs.
 
Chelsea: Yeah so ummm, what was my question for that…? So did that meet your expectations?
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah. Does she, does Alexa, like…. hold other music than just Amazon music?
 
Chelsea: Yes, you can link to Pandora and Spotify which is of my favorite things and listening my headphones when I walk home and then I walked to my house and pause my music and say Alexa Play and it picks up my Spotify like mid song.
 
Interviewee #5: Ohhh, nice.
 
Chelsea: That’s that’s really nice. But and then. So throughout this test I used to have Alexa Play your favorite song. And then people would be like, “Alexa, play my favorite song.” Then I saw like, no no no.
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah yeah yeah.
 
Chelsea: Um, so how do you normally handle playing music?
 
Interviewee #5: I have a Spotify App actually I just click it.
 
Chelsea: I  got the the Spotify student plan. That’s why I’ve been here for 7 years.
 
Chelsea: OK. So you’re getting ready in the morning and you want to hear current events have Alexa catch you up.
 
Interviewee #5: List news.
 
Alexa: Here is your flash briefing: in things to try.
 
Alexa: Help me understand your unique voice by using voice training. Go to the voice training section in the Alexa app. A brief session will help us to communicate even better.
 
Chelsea: That’s going.
 
Alexa: In NPR News: NPR News in Washington…
 
Chelsea: So I did that meet your expectations?
 
Interviewee #5: Yeah yeah it was it’s cool but she still picked it up. Yes because I was really clueless so.
 
Chelsea: So what did that mean. What did Alexa tell you first?</p>

<p>Interviewee #5: She wanted to clarify with me probably because my voice was slow.
 
Interviewee #5: So she was like OK let’s not be weird when we talk to each other. And then. Yeah and then she somehow found what I was actually saying.
 
Chelsea: Yeah it’s really flexible. So you said list news, if you had to rephrase that how would you?
 
Interviewee #5: I feel like I would just say things because maybe she would pick that up or current news or something.
 
Chelsea: How would you handle this task outside of a VUI?
 
Interviewee #5: Normally it’s just something that I see on the Internet like while I was browsing. I suppose I don’t really watch news on TV.
 
Chelsea: And the NPR clip is what you expected as news?
 
Interviewee #5: Oh yeah I didn’t know that it would actually play like the news.
 
Interviewee #5: We got that I thought she would just maybe say like this is happening here or something. So that’s awesome.
 
Chelsea: Are you good on time?</p>

<p>Interviewee #5: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chelsea: OK. Awesome. So the first thing is I just want to follow up that for most of you prompts you Alexa to do something. So this last prompt you gave a command. Why do you think this changed?
 
Interviewee #5: Oh yes.
 
Chelsea: So what do you think there’s a difference between asking and telling her.?
 
Interviewee #5: Yes.
 
Interviewee #5: I don’t know. Well actually so I thought about saying Alexa for the last time but then I was like maybe I don’t need to say that now. Oh OK. Yeah. Yes so yes so exactly like it. If you have the actual one, Alexa is what you says for her to start listening? Yeah. So that’s kind of what I thought at first but then I realized that I might not do that. So that’s why I stopped it.
 
Chelsea: So what was the easy prompt for you to do and why do you think.?
 
Interviewee #5: Was the first timer. Yeah definitely.</p>

<p>Chelsea: And why do you think that was easier for you?
 
Interviewee #5: Because it seems like something that would be easy for a computer to do. So that’s why I was just like OK. Set the timer because you’ll probably get it.
 
Chelsea: What’s your most difficult?
 
Interviewee #5: Maybe the either the grocery list or the News just because I didn’t know that. Like I didn’t know if she could just pick up if I said like grocery list or manage grocery list or something like that.
 
Chelsea: And so some more open questions. What do you think about voice user interfaces in general? I know you know I am researching them but you can say, “Honestly I think say are crap.”
 
Interviewee #5: I mean honestly if they were better I would love it. Like I’m still considering getting it so I can just play with it.
 
Chelsea: I guess you get really dependent on it.
 
Interviewee #5: Yes, like it, it can be really nice and convenient.
 
Chelsea: It’s a good gift because I never wanted to buy it myself. Someone bought of for me and now I’m like.
 
Interviewee #5: Obsessed?
 
Chelsea: And now I brought it downstairs, so I brought it here and I left if for awhile. I left it here and I finally realized it’s like I will come home and ask Alexa something I you get nothing.
 
Interviewee #5: Just like…what… Alexa?? Where are you?
 
Chelsea: There is one last thing for you is why do you think in general that we didn’t discuss any additional comments.
 
Interviewee #5: No.</p>
